                <p><br>Networking is a vital part of career development because it helps you access opportunities that <br>
                    aren’t always publicly advertised, gain insider knowledge about industries, and build relationships
                    that can lead to mentorship, referrals, or collaborations. <br> <br>
                    It allows you to learn from others experiences, stay 
                    informed about trends, and improve your communication and interpersonal skills. Whether through
                    informational interviews, professional events, or platforms like LinkedIn, networking helps you build a reputation, stay top of mind,
                    and open doors that might not be available through applications alone. <br> <br> Simply put, who you know, and who knows you, can make a big difference in your career journey.

                    Subject: UMSI BSI Student Seeking Your Advice <br>
                    Dear Mr. Johnson,
                    <br><br>
                    My name is Alexis, and I will be a senior in the UMSI BSI program at U-M this fall. I'm interested
                    in learning more about careers in UX research, and <br>
                    I saw on LinkedIn that you currently work in UX Research at Google. As an alum, I know your
                    perspective about your current role and the steps you took to get there would be very helpful.
                    <br><br>
                    I would be happy to meet via phone or Zoom. I know this may be a busy time, so if we aren't able to
                    meet within the next two weeks, <br>
                    I'll be sure to check back in to see if sometime later this summer would work better.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you so much, <br>
                    Alexis
